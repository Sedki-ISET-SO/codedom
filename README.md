<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
Codedom is a version control for managing coding project in a collaborative level. Members can upload code to their repositories, invite their team members to collaborate in committing into the project, raise issues, and earn money with our tokens system(the orbs system). By becoming an active contributor inside Codedom you gain orbs that can then be used to power you up with goodies inside Codedom, orbs can contribute to the financial aspect as a member, they can be cashed out and converted to real money!  

Main Functionalities:
* Users can create up to 7 repositories with 31mb as max size for each repository to host their coding project, when you create your first repository you gain the Contributor Badge and 3 orbs :1st_place_medal:
* Repository owner can specifiy the repository visiblity, either private or public
* Private repositories can be shared by generating a temporarly functional link incase you wish to share your repository with a certain amount of outsiders :detective: 
* Contributors inside a specific repository can drag and drop project directories, files from their local machine, or they can create files inside the application and use the inbuilt file editor to make changes to their files
* Repository owner can invite other users, contributors to his repository, he can also kick contributors out of his repository :smile:
* Contributors can raise issues inside a repository and can possibly link the file names related to a specific issue  
* Repository owner can use his god mode to revert to a previous committed changes inside his repository
* Automated Ranking ladder for top contributors and for most used programming languages inside Codedom, note that HTML and CSS will not be counted :smile:

Of course, this is not the file list for our functionalities, more will come. You may also suggest changes, functionalities!

the `Orbs system` will be explained in near future as Codedom development progresses.
